            "1. Directly recommend the number of card draws generated by the player's blind box draw, and the optimization proposal for the probability of winning;",
            "2. Add the optimized settings of the card combination \"A, 2, 3, 4, 5\";",
            "The above two proposals are fully supported by the technical community. Since the above two proposals involve changes to the whole set of main contracts, the existing asset contracts will be redeployed through a hard fork, and all user assets will be automatically mapped to the new contract. PK currency assets.",
            "The entire development and deployment work is expected to be about 7 days. During the deployment period, to ensure the security of the token contract, the PancakeSwap PK coin selling 10% fee unilateral burning mechanism is temporarily closed, and other functions will not be affected in any way.",
